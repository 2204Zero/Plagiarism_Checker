Technology has become an important part of daily life, and this importance of technology keeps increasing every day. People use technology for communication, use technology for education, use technology for work, and use technology for entertainment. The role of technology in modern society is so common and so repeated that many descriptions of technology sound similar. Modern devices, modern tools, and modern systems are used everywhere, and these modern systems create a world where digital actions are completely normal. Many people depend on digital devices to complete tasks, and many people repeat the same pattern of using phones, laptops, and the internet. Because technology is widely used, widely accepted, and widely repeated, the description of technology often includes similar statements. The advantages of technology, the benefits of technology, and the uses of technology are discussed in almost every article, creating a repeated pattern of ideas. People talk about efficiency, talk about convenience, and talk about improvement, which again creates repeated language. This repetition makes the topic of technology appear similar across many texts, and this repeated style helps similarity-checking algorithms easily detect matching patterns.
